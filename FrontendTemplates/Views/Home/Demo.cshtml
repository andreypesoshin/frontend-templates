@model BundleOptions

<h2>Bundling Hint</h2>
@switch (Model)
{
    case BundleOptions.Normal:
        <p>You are in <b>DEVELOPMENT mode</b>. All assets are used as is.</p>
        break;
    case BundleOptions.Combined:
    <p>You are in <b>TEST mode</b>. All assets are combined together (separate files for css and js bundles) and used without minification.</p>
        break;
    case BundleOptions.MinifiedAndCombined:
    <p>You are in <b>PRODUCTION mode</b>. All assets are combined together and minified.</p>
        break;
}
<p>We have 5 bundles used at this page (you can always reorganize assets as you want):</p>
<ul>
    <li>app.css.bundle</li>
    <li>app.js.bundle</li>
    <li>modernizr.js.bundle</li>
    <li>jquery.js.bundle</li>
    <li>demo.js.bundle</li>
</ul>

<p>Please feel free to inspect page source and checkout <strong>&lt;head&gt;</strong> section to confirm that bundles are processed as expected.</p>

Personally for your comfort we have added the head context into the <strong>blockquote</strong> above:
